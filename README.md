Gloption is a stock analysis tool to determine positive swings in stocks for your benefit.
The idea is to pick out solid, historically resiliant and active stocks to trade.
The scanner in particular looks for stocks with solid analysts ratings and having the stock close higher than it opens.


Ofcouse if this worked 100 percent of the time I would not be sharing it, but the strategy I use is to kepp a short stop loss 
like 2 percent. The idea is to cut the loosers and reap the rewards of the winning stocks, much like Warren Buffet's strategy.

This is for educational purposes and the scores can be easily manipulated by aqcuisitions, earnings, macroeconmic effects and other 
events which particularly impact stock prices.
